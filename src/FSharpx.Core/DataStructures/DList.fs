/// The DList is an implementation of John Hughes' append list.
/// See http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=8475 for more information.
/// This implementation adds an additional parameter to allow a more
/// efficient calculation of the list length.
/// Note that an alternate form would represent the DList as:
/// type DList<'a> = DList of ('a list -> 'a list)
/// An example can be found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5324623/functional-o1-append-and-on-iteration-from-first-element-list-data-structure/5327209#5327209
